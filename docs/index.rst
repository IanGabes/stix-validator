Welcome to stix-validator's documentation!
==========================================

The Structued Threat Information eXpression (STIX) is a collaborative
community-driven effort to define and develop a standardized language to
represent structured cyber threat information and is currently implemented
in XML Schema.

The **stix-validator** library and scripts helps validate STIX XML content
using `XML Schema`_, `STIX Suggested Practices`_, and `STIX Profile`_
validation.
