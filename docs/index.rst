Welcome to stix-validator's documentation!
==========================================

The Structued Threat Information eXpression (STIX) and Cyber Observable
eXpression (CybOX) are collaborative, community-driven efforts to define and
develop standardized languages to represent structured cyber threat information
and are currently implemented in XML Schema.

The **stix-validator** library and scripts helps validate `STIX XML`_ content
using XML Schema, `STIX Suggested Practices`_, and `STIX Profile`_
validation. The **stix-validator** library also provides `CybOX XML`_
validation capabilities!
